# 📝 To-Do List Web App

Hi there! 👋
This is a simple **To-Do List** web app that helps you write down tasks, mark them as done, or remove them when you're finished.

It’s a great beginner project to practice **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** in one place!

---

### 🚀 What does it do?

* ✅ Add tasks to your list
* ❌ Delete tasks with a click on the “×”
* ✔️ Click on a task to mark it as **completed**
* 📌 Your list stays saved (thanks to `localStorage`) even if you refresh the page!

---

### 🛠️ How it's built

#### 1. **HTML** – The Structure 🧱

We created a basic layout with:

* A title and an input box
* An "Add" button
* A container to hold the task list

#### 2. **CSS** – The Style 🎨

We used CSS to make everything look neat:

* Nice background and centered layout
* Custom styles for the tasks and delete button
* Cross-out effect for completed tasks

#### 3. **JavaScript** – The Brain 🧠

This is where the magic happens:

* When you click **Add**, it checks if the input is empty.
* If not, it adds the task as a list item.
* It also creates an **×** symbol (a `<span>`) to delete the task.
* You can click a task to mark it as done.
* We also save your list using `localStorage`, so your tasks don't disappear when you reload!

### 👩‍💻 Why this project?

Because it's:

* Beginner-friendly
* Practical
* A mix of structure (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JS)
* A real-world app you can build and show off!
